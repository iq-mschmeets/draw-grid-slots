# Draw Grid Slots

[Edit on StackBlitz ⚡️](https://stackblitz.com/edit/rxjs-gyg1de)

This project allows you to choose a regular base grid and *draw* objects onto the grid.
You can move and resize the objects.

### TODO:
* Keep the box dimensions constrained to grid areas.
* Implement _Box Types_ the boxes should represent specific types of things which have their own unique datasets.
